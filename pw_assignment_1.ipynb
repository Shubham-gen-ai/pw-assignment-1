        "  - Can be modified after creation (e.g., lists, sets, dictionaries).  \n",
        "  - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]` → `my_list[0] = 100` changes the list in place.  \n",

        "**Type casting** in Python is the process of converting one data type into another. It can be either **implicit** (automatic) or **explicit** (manual).\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Explicit Type Casting** (Manual):\n",
        "   - You explicitly convert a value using built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.\n",
        "   - Common functions:\n",
        "     - `int()`: Converts to integer.\n",
